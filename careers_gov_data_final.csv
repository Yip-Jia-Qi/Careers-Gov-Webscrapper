The main role of SCDF is to provide fire-fighting, rescue and emergency ambulance services; mitigating hazardous materials incidents, as well as formulate, implement and enforce regulations on fire safety and civil defence shelter matters.  In 1982, the National Civil Defence Plan was launched which spearheaded the emergency preparedness for the nation. With the enactment of the Civil Defence Act in 1986, the SCDF was established as an independent organisation under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). In the same year, the Hotel New World collapse paved the way for joint operations between the SCDF and Singapore Fire Service (SFS). Due to the similarity in roles and functions, the SCDF and SFS were formally integrated on 15 April 1989.  Over the years, the SCDF has improved its life saving operations through innovations and programmes to enhance her fire-fighting, rescue capabilities and public education plans. The Light Fire Attack Vehicle (The Red Rhino) and Unmanned Fire-Fighting Machine are some of the customized solutions which the force has developed to increase its operational capabilities. The SCDF also actively engages the local community through its wide-ranging public educational programmes and community-based activities to enhance the resilience and emergency preparedness of the civilian population.  Today, the Force is recognised by the population as a professional body of well-trained officers and men geared to respond to all types of life-threatening emergencies round-the-clock.
